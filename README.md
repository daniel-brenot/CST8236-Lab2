Wacky Wavy Arm Inflatable Tube Man!!! This application creates a wacky wavy arm inflatable tube man that just keeps going!
This was made during my enrollment at Algonquin College for a graphics project using SFML.

## Prerequisites
You must have installed the SFML library and its required headers to build and run the application

## Building
This application is designed for linux, so a build.sh file is present

## Running
Run the build.sh file and the application should run automatically after building
